# Python scripts that help analysing 16S rRNA gene or ITS2 ampliconsequencing analysis with Qiime2

The Qiime2 software requires some files to read like a manifest file containing sample-id, filepath and read direction. Furthermore, if you download Files from Basespace, each file has its own folder, what makes it hard to deal with them. There are also other scripts which might be useful like converting the .qza into a .csv file to read into R. 

## Getting Started

just download the scripts and change the input paths and you can start 

### Prerequisites
